Step 1: Write a query that will return all states along with their population IF the sum of their population is above 10 million. You will need to look up `$match` and `$gte`.

db.zips.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$state", totalPop: { $sum: "$pop" } } },
  { $match: { totalPop: { $gte: 10000000 } } }
]);

Step 2: Write a query that will return the average population for each city.

db.zips.aggregate([
    { $group: { _id: "$city", averagePop: { $avg: "$pop" } } }
]);

Step 3: Alter the query above to sort by the average population in descending order.

db.zips.aggregate([
    { $group: { _id: "$city", averagePop: { $avg: "$pop" } } },
    { $sort: { averagePop: -1 } }
]);
